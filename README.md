# Mydo

https://mydo.loremus.gay

Mydo is a category based , local first to do list I made mainly for myself :3 Simple checklists based on different categories and parts of your life. Don't overload yourself managing complex apps with multiple parts when all you need is a simple checklist.

## Why

#### Category Based

There are multiple things going on in our lives simultaneously, the idea of having a simple checklist works but doesn't hold up as our checklist grows big and complex consisting of everything from work related tasks to personal goals and hobbies, the list becomes un manageable
Categories add a lot of organization compared to a single checklist without adding much to complexity allowing you to manage many things at once :3

#### Open Source

The project is based on what I used prior to it "Google Keep" as I de-Googled my life I ran into issue where I couldn't find any functionally similar app to it so I made it myself and made it FOSS :3

#### Local First

Note: The app is not local first rn, I am still working on it and it requires access to internet to fetch some React components even for PWA.
Local first allows the app to be used anywhere with or without internet connection making it easier to manage work and accessibility and management when I am in low or no internet connection areas.

#### Privacy Focused

People put a lot of personal and important things in their to do lists, information that shouldn't be tracked or stored in some remote server by a corporation to be used for "Personalization" (Advertising & AI training)
Mydo uses IndexedDB to store your tasks in your browser, not tracked or stored in some unknown remote server halfway across the world to be trained on by blackbox algorithms to advertise to you.
